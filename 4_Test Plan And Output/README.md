## Test Plan

### High Level Test Plan

|Test ID | Description |	Exp I/P	| Exp O/P |	Actual Output |	Type of Test |
|-----| -------- | ---- | ----| -------- | ----- |
| H_01 | Components Testing	| The working of the components is taken as the input |	Pass | Pass	| Requirement Based|
| H_02 | Software Testing	| The inputs required is given | Pass |	Pass |	Scenario Based |
| H_03 | System Testing	| The inputs of the components is given to the system |	Pass |	Pass | Boundary Based|

### Low Level Test Plan

|Test ID |	Description |	Exp I/P |	Exp O/P |	Actual Output	 |Type of Test |
|-----| --------| ---- | ---- | -------- | ----- |
| L_01 | The components required for the project is tested for the further process |The working of the components is taken as the input |	Pass |	Pass |	Requirement Based|
| L_02 | The software used for the sysytem is tested and if it is passed in the test it is used for the further process	|The inputs required is given | Pass | Pass | scenario Based|
| L_03 |	Overall system is tested and then it is approved for the next process	| The inputs of the components is given to the system	 | Pass |	Pass |	Boundary Based|

## Best Practices

 - [x] Checked all the possibilities of output
 - [x] Mentioned all the inputs for better understanding
 - [x] Presented in tabular form for easy understanding
 - [x] Both High level and low level Test plans are shown
